"""


Nina is working on a project involving multiple sensors. Each sensor provides a data point that needs to be processed to compute an aggregated value. 



Given data points from three sensors, write a program to calculate the aggregated value using specific bitwise operations and arithmetic manipulations. The final result should be the aggregated value modulo 1000.



Example:

Input:

1 //sensor 1 data

2 //sensor 2 data

3 //sensor 3 data

Output

9

Explanation

Calculate the bitwise AND of sensor 1 data and sensor 2 data: 0

Calculate the XOR of the result from step 1 and sensor 3 data: 3

Multiply the result from step 2 by 3: 9

Compute the final aggregated value by taking the result from step 3 modulo 1000: 9

So, the aggregated value is 9.

Input format :
The first line of input consists of an integer S1, representing sensor1 data.

The second line of input consists of an integer S2, representing sensor2 data.

The third line of input consists of an integer S3, representing sensor3 data.

Output format :
The output displays an integer representing the aggregated value """

# You are using Python
a = int(input())
b = int(input())
c = int(input())

and_result = a & b 
xor_result = and_result ^ c
multipied_result = xor_result * 3
aggregated_value = multipied_result % 1000

print(aggregated_value)
